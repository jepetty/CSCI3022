degrees_of_freedom:
	Pretty simple using the formula, note formula is standard deviation => don't need to square the variance

unbiased_sample_variance:
	Also not challenging once you have the formula. Make sure you do unbiased and not regular.

t_statistic:
	Also not very challenging given the formula. Just plug and chug.

t_test:
	This one was fairly trivial if you knew the formulas for everything. First, calculate the means and variances for both distributions. Then, use these and the two samples to calculate the t statistic (using the function I already wrote) and the degrees of freedom (again, using the function I already wrote). The trickiest part was actually learning enough about the scipy.stats.t library to calculate the p-value. This requires the t statistic and then the degrees of freedom plus one. After that, the p-value is twice times this number subtracted from one.
