degrees_of_freedom:
	Pretty simple using the formula, note formula is standard deviation => don't need to square the variance

unbiased_sample_variance:
	Also not challenging once you have the formula. Make sure you do unbiased and not regular.

t_statistic:
	Also not very challenging given the formula. Just plug and chug.

t_test:
	This one was fairly trivial if you knew the formulas for everything. First, calculate the means and variances for both distributions. Then, use these and the two samples to calculate the t statistic (using the function I already wrote) and the degrees of freedom (again, using the function I already wrote). The trickiest part was actually learning enough about the scipy.stats.t library to calculate the p-value. This requires the t statistic and then the degrees of freedom plus one. After that, the p-value is twice times this number subtracted from one. 

chisquare_pvalue:
	This one wasn't terribly tricky knowing the formula for chi square value of a table of observed and expected values. One thing that helped here was knowing that it was just a 2x2 table. 

add_sentence:
	I just looped through all the bigrams, made sure each word in the bigram was in the vocabulary, then added counts to a dictionary where the first key was the second word and the value was another dictionary where the first word was the key and the count of that bigram was the value

valid_bigrams:
	Just looped through the dictionary of dictionaries of counts I made in add_sentence, made sure the count was greater than or equal to the minimum allowed count, then returned an array of the bigrams as a tuple.
