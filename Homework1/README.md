Data Wrangling
===============

Overview
---------------

This homework focuses on the first steps of getting data into a usable
form to start asking very simple questions.  We'll start asking more
complicated questions very soon!

This homework should not be very difficult if you can program in
Python.  If this homework is particularly challenging, you may not
have enough of a programming background for the course and need to
quickly get up to speed or consider another course.

This program will be autograded.  That means that it's important to
not change function names and to not add additional functionality that
may improve the program but produce different results.  Make sure that
your unit tests pass.  This what a successful set of unit tests will
look like:

    $ python3 tests.py
    .....
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 5 tests in 0.002s
    
    OK

If you do not get this result from running the tests, you will not get
a good grade.  Be sure to also look at the test file carefully, as it
will give you examples of how the functions you need to implement are
supposed to work.

As with all our homeworks, we will distribute the code via git.  You
are strongly encouraged to clone the repository so that if there are
changes in the assignment (e.g., to fix an error), you can quickly
merge your modified code using git.  If you find an error, Pull
requests are quite welcome!  Another advantage of cloning this
repository is that you'll also be able to very quickly download
subsequent homeworks by pulling from this upstream repository.

District Margins (15 points)
----------------------------

In the US, our legislature is made up of representatives of individual
*districts* (unlike proportional representation systems).  Some of
these districts are competitive, meaning that the winner of the
election is not a "sure thing" based on the voters in the districts.
However, for a variety of reasons, many of these districts are not
very competitive.  We're going to look at the 2014 election and see
which districts are competitive.  This also gives us a chance to play
around with some continuous data (well, sort of; we'll assume votes
are continuous even though you can't have a fractional vote).

You will output to a file with the districts sorted by how competitive
they are (with the most competitive districts first).  If an election
is uncontested, the margin should be "100", in that the percentage
difference between the first place candidate and the second is 100.  

    $ python districts.py
    $ head district_totals.csv
    STATE,DISTRICT,MARGIN
    Arizona,2,0.07000000000000028
    California,7,0.7999999999999972
    Florida,2,1.1299999999999955
    Minnesota,8,1.3999999999999986
    Maryland,6,1.4500000000000028
    California,16,1.4599999999999937
    Washington,4,1.6200000000000045
    Texas,23,2.1000000000000014
    Iowa,1,2.280000000000001
    $ tail district_totals.csv
    Georgia,3,100.0
    Georgia,14,100.0
    Florida,25,100
    Georgia,5,100.0
    Florida,14,100
    Georgia,11,100.0
    Pennsylvania,18,100.0
    West Virginia,5,100.0
    West Virginia,4,100.0
    Florida,27,100

To complete this assignment you'll need to complete three functions:
* district_margins
* all_states
* all_state_rows

You should not need to modify the "main" function.

Words Presidents Use (15 points)
-------------------------------

Each year, the president of the United States is required to make a
speech to congress describing the "State of the Union".  You will
count the most frequent words in all of the past addresses (we'll do
more interesting things with this later).

We've placed all of these in a zip file, with each speech as a
separate fill inside the zip archive.  To complete this assignment,
you'll need to go through each of the files, find the words, and then
sum them up.  This has been broken down into three functions you'll
need to complete:
* text_from_zipfile
* words
* accumulate_counts

We define a word as four or more contiguous characters in the range
a-z or A-Z.  The resulting words should be lower case.  This removes
punctuation, short words, and other distracting information from the
files.

Writeup (10 points)
-----------------------

Finally, include a brief plain-text file (not PDF, not Word, just a
plain ASCII text file) that explains:
* The approach you took to solve the problem
* What external resources (if any) you used
* Any interesting observations you have from your results

Submitting Your Code
-----------------------

You'll need to submit your assignment (word_counts.py, districts.py,
and writeup.txt) on
[Moodle](https://moodle.cs.colorado.edu/course/view.php?id=49) as an
upload.
