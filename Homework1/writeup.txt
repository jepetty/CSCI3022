all_states(lines)
	Simply iterated over all the lines in the document, if the value for "STATE" was unique I returned it, otherwise I kept going
	JUST KIDDING THAT DIDN'T work!!! expecting a set as the return thing-> the only way to do that is to iterate over the whole group of lines within creating the set, so that's what I did. :)

all_state_rows(lines,state)
	This one was simple in this function, simply checked if the states matched, and if they did I returned that state's line BUT the tricky part came from the function district_margins(statelines) -> this one recognized that some of the states' "D" column wasn't clean, so I had to clean it by removing extraneous details to get this method to pass
