MY APPROACH
ml_mean:
	This method was pretty simple, just found the sum of whatever was passed in and divided by the length of that array
ml_variance:
	This method was also pretty simple. Did some functional programming to to find the square of the difference between each value and the mean, then returned this value divided by the total number of values input
log_probability:
	Also pretty simple given the equation for proability of a Normal variable. Just returned this probability with values substituted in for appropriate variables.
republican_share:
	This method was also not too challenging. I created a dictionary to store the tuple of (state, district) with the value of the republican percentage for that entry (only if the entry corresponded to a republican candidate). With a little bit of data cleaning to cast the strings to the appropriate data type, it was not too challenging!!
